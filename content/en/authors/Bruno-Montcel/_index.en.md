He received his M.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering and M.Sc. degree in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Strasbourg, France, in 2006. He received his PhD in Electrical Engineering from the University of Lyon in 2009 with a thesis on time-resolved fluorescence molecular tomography, which won the best thesis award in the French section of IEEE EMBS. From 2009 to 2012, he worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Physics, Politecnico di Milano, Italy, working on structured light for diffuse optics. In 2013, he joined the Biological and Healthcare Microtechnology Department of CEA in Grenoble, France, working on spectral X-ray nondestructive testing. Since 2014, he has been working as an associate professor at the Department of Electrical Engineering and at CREATIS, a biomedical imaging laboratory at the University of Lyon.
