He received his engineering degree and M.Sc. degree in electrical engineering from ENSEEIHT, Toulouse, France. Hélène Ratiney received a degree in signal processing from ENSEEIHT Toulouse in 2001 (both in 2001) and a PhD in "Signals and Imaging" from the University of Lyon 1 in October 2004. Her PhD project was dedicated to the development of quantitative methods for the in vivo spectroscopy of 1D MRS short echo times (method QUEST). During her postdoctoral position (2005-2007, PI Daniel Pelletier), she participated in a longitudinal study (EPIC/GeneMSA) at the University of California, San Francisco, which followed 500 MS patients per year since 2004, with the aim of capturing the changes and learning factors that control the evolution of the disease. Her main contributions include the development of a quantitative strategy for brain spectral imaging data to obtain tissue-specific (white matter/grey matter) biochemical information: metabolite T1, metabolite concentrations. Back in France, she has been developing different projects in quantitative MRI / MRS with the common goal of using optimized methods to improve the acquisition and processing of MRI or MRS data and to test them in preclinical or clinical studies.
