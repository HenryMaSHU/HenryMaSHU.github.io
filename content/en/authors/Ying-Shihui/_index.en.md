Shihui Ying, PhD, is a professor and PhD supervisor in the Department of Mathematics at Shanghai University. He received his B.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2001 and 2008, and did his postdoctoral research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2012-2013. He is currently a member of the Intersection Committee of Medicine and Mathematics of the Chinese Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics and a director of the Medical Operations Management Branch of the Chinese Society of Operations Research. He has established a unified mathematical framework based on flow-constrained optimization around inverse problems on manifolds and their applications, and formed new theories and methods for the characterization of alignment and normalization problems. The corresponding results have been published in top international journals such as NeuroImage, IEEE T-PAMI, IEEE T-NNLS, IEEE T-Cyber, Pattern Recognition, and top conferences such as CVPR and IJCAI, and the results have been cited more than 1600 times. He has led many key projects of National Key R&D Program, National Natural Science Foundation of China and Shanghai Science and Technology Commission. He has been invited as guest editor of several SCI journals and member of TPC of famous international conferences, and invited and presented in groups in several important academic conferences at home and abroad.
